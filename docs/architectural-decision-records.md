# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
## Tattoo Marketplace Platform

This document contains architectural decisions made for the tattoo marketplace platform, following the ADR format.

## ADR-001: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Engineering Team  

### Context
The tattoo marketplace involves complex business domains (artists, clients, bookings, payments) with intricate relationships and business rules. We need an architecture that can handle this complexity while remaining maintainable.

### Decision
Implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with the following structure:
- Separate domain, application, infrastructure, and presentation layers
- Use aggregates to enforce business invariants
- Implement domain events for loose coupling
- Apply repository pattern for data access abstraction

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Clear separation of business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Better testability through dependency inversion
- Scalable architecture that can evolve with business requirements
- Improved communication between business and technical teams

**Negative:**
- Increased initial complexity and learning curve
- More boilerplate code compared to simpler architectures
- Requires discipline to maintain boundaries

### Implementation
```
src/
├── domain/          # Business logic, entities, value objects
├── application/     # Use cases, commands, queries
├── infrastructure/  # Data access, external services
└── presentation/    # API controllers, UI components
```

## ADR-002: CQRS Pattern for Read/Write Separation

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-20  
**Deciders:** Engineering Team, Product Team  

### Context
The platform has different performance requirements for read and write operations:
- Artist search requires fast, optimized queries with filtering and pagination
- Portfolio browsing needs efficient image loading and caching
- Booking creation involves complex validations and business rules

### Decision
Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):
- Separate command handlers for write operations
- Dedicated query handlers for read operations
- Optimized read models for complex queries
- Event sourcing for critical business events

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Optimized performance for both reads and writes
- Independent scaling of read and write sides
- Simplified query models tailored to UI needs
- Better auditability through event sourcing

**Negative:**
- Eventual consistency between command and query sides
- Increased complexity in data synchronization
- Need for event handling infrastructure

### Implementation
```typescript
// Commands for writes
CreateBookingCommand → CreateBookingHandler → BookingRepository

// Queries for reads  
GetArtistsQuery → GetArtistsQueryHandler → ArtistReadModel
```

- Server-side rendering for SEO (artist profiles, portfolios)
- API routes for backend functionality
- Modern React features (Server Components, Suspense)
- Type-safe routing

### Decision
Use Next.js App Router with:
- App directory structure for better organization
- Server Components for performance
- Route handlers for API endpoints
- Parallel routes for complex layouts

### Consequences

- Improved performance with Server Components
- Co-located API and UI code
- Built-in caching and optimization

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for new App Router patterns
- Some features still in beta
- Migration complexity from existing Pages Router code

### Implementation
```
app/
├── api/v1/          # API routes
├── (public)/        # Public pages (artist profiles, search)
├── (authenticated)/ # Protected pages (dashboard, bookings)
└── layout.tsx       # Root layout
```

### Implementation
```prisma
model Artist {
  id              String @id @default(uuid())
  email           String @unique
  name            String
  bio             String
  specialties     ArtistSpecialty[]
  portfolioImages PortfolioImage[]
  bookings        Booking[]
  isVerified      Boolean @default(false)
  rating          Decimal @default(0)
  createdAt       DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime @updatedAt
}
```
