# Deployment Strategy for Tattoo Marketplace Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive deployment strategy for the Tattoo Marketplace platform, covering infrastructure provisioning, security implementation, monitoring setup, and deployment orchestration across multiple environments.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- **VPC Module**: Secure network architecture with public/private subnets
- **Security Module**: Security groups, WAF, and access controls
- **Database Module**: RDS PostgreSQL with encryption and backups
- **ECS Module**: Containerized application deployment
- **CDN Module**: CloudFront distribution for static assets
- **Monitoring Module**: CloudWatch, SNS, and Application Insights

### 2. Container Strategy
- **Multi-stage Docker builds** for optimized image size
- **Non-root user execution** for security
- **Security scanning** integrated into build process
- **Container registry** with vulnerability scanning
- **Health checks** and graceful shutdowns

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- **Automated testing** with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Security scanning** with SAST, DAST, and dependency checks
- **Container building** with multi-platform support
- **Infrastructure deployment** with Terraform
- **Application deployment** with rollback capabilities
- **Post-deployment testing** and validation

### 4. Environment Management
- **Development**: Local development with Docker Compose
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for testing
- **Production**: High-availability deployment with monitoring

### 5. Security Integration
- **Zero-trust architecture** with encrypted communication
- **SAST/DAST scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Container security** with vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets management** with AWS Secrets Manager
- **Compliance monitoring** with automated checks

### 6. Monitoring & Observability
- **Application monitoring** with custom metrics and health checks
- **Infrastructure monitoring** with CloudWatch and Application Insights
- **Log aggregation** with structured logging
- **Alerting** with SNS and Slack integration
- **Distributed tracing** with X-Ray

## Deployment Types

### Rolling Deployment (Default)
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh staging rolling
```
- **Use case**: Regular updates with minimal downtime
- **Downtime**: ~30 seconds during service restart
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback to previous version
- **Risk**: Low - gradual replacement of instances

### Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh production blue-green
```
- **Use case**: Zero-downtime deployments for critical updates
- **Downtime**: 0 seconds
- **Rollback**: Instant switch back to blue environment
- **Risk**: Medium - requires double resources temporarily

### Canary Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh staging canary
```
- **Use case**: High-risk changes with gradual rollout
- **Downtime**: 0 seconds
- **Rollback**: Automatic based on health metrics
- **Risk**: Low - limited blast radius with monitoring

- **Secrets management** with AWS Secrets Manager

### Compliance
- **GDPR compliance** with data rights and consent management
- **SOC 2 Type II** controls implementation
- **CCPA compliance** for California users
- **Security auditing** with automated compliance checks

## Monitoring Strategy

### Application Metrics
```javascript
// Key metrics tracked
- Response time (95th percentile)
- Error rate (4xx, 5xx responses)
- Throughput (requests per second)
- User engagement metrics
- Business KPIs (registrations, bookings)
```

### Infrastructure Metrics
```yaml
# CloudWatch metrics
CPU Utilization: >80% for 5 minutes → Alert
Memory Usage: >80% for 5 minutes → Alert
Database Connections: >50 connections → Warning
Disk Space: >85% usage → Alert
Network Errors: >1% error rate → Alert
```

### Alerting Configuration
```yaml
Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):
  - Application down (health check fails)
  - Database connection failures
  - High error rate (>5% 5xx errors)
  - Security incidents

Warning Alerts (Next Business Day):
  - High resource usage (CPU, Memory >80%)
  - Slow response times (>5 seconds)
  - Unusual traffic patterns
  - Certificate expiration (30 days)
```
