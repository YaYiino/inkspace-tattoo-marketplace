## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Schema
The database schema is already updated in `supabase-schema.sql`. Ensure these tables exist:
- `profiles` (with user_type field)
- `artists` (with bio, experience_years, specialties, portfolio_images)
- `studios` (with name, description, address, hourly_rate, amenities, images)

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup
Run the SQL commands in `supabase-storage-setup.sql`:

```sql
-- Create storage buckets
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES 
  ('portfolio-images', 'portfolio-images', true),
  ('studio-images', 'studio-images', true);
```

Then apply the Row Level Security policies included in the file.

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` has the Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 4. File Structure
The following files have been created:

```
